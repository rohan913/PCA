Custom GFP Reference Creation

Do NOT use textEdit on Mac because of Carriage returns ruining formats
Use Linux or plaintext editor that avoids this

Steps:

1.Know your Vector and get Sequences of Interest:
We used Rosa-CAG-LSL-ZsGreen1-WPRE targeting vector (sequence taken from website: https://www.jax.org/strain/007906). Since we have 3’ sequencing it was necessary to include the WPRE as part of the sequence in addition to the Zsgreen sequence. This is because woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) is used to enhance the mRNA transcript stability

2.Update Fasta File:
Here we needed to update the mouse reference fasta by prepending the additional sequence as its own chromosome.
>gfp dna:chromosome chromosome:mm10GFP:gfp:1:696:1

3.Update Your gtf file:
In our case we used Zsgreen1 GFP-WPRE and added it to the beginning as:

gfp     ensembl exon    1       696     .       +       .       gene_id “gfp”; transcript_id “gfp”;

4.Run cellranger mkref to create the reference
